# AutoPosterModTool

AutoPosterModTool is a tool to easily create a mod to replace posters in the Lethal Company ship.

## Usage

Use the templates in the "templates" folder to lay out the images you want to use as posters.

- The "posterSet.png" template is for poster sets, a group of up to 5 images that appears in the ship as posters.

- The "tipsPoster.png" template is for a tips poster, a single poster that appears independently of the poster set (it is just an 557 x 716 image, but a "template" is still included).

If you have images than needed or you want to keep the aspect ratio of your desired image, you can leave a transparent background. The only important thing is to keep templates sizes, and to stay within borders.

You'll also need a 512 x 512 png for the mod icon. 

Once you images are ready, simply launch the .exe file and enter the needed info, select your images for the mod icon / poster set(s) / tips posters, then click "Create Mod".

The mod will be zipped so it is ready to upload to Thunderstore.
